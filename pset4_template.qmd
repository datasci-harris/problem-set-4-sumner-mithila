**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_\_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

1. After reviewing the entirety of the pset and the questions that are asked, I pulled the following variables: 

- PRVDR_CTGRY_CD: Provider type 
- PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD: Subtype code 
- PRVDR_NUM: CMS Certification Number
- PGM_TRMNTN_CD: Provider termination code 
- ZIP_CD: Zip code 
- FAC_NAME: Provider name 
- FY_END_MO_DAY_CD: Year of suspected closure

base_path = r"C:\Users\12019\\Downloads\pos2016"
path = os.path.join(base_path, "pos2016.csv")
pos2016 = pd.read_csv(path)

# Subset to PRVDR_CTGRY_CD = 01 and PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD = 01

```

Subsetting to short-term hospitals gives a dataset with 7245 total facilities. According to the linked paper, there are nearly 5,000 short-term acute care hospitals which is a smaller subset than what I found with subsetting. Another data source (https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals) cites a total of 6,120 hospitals in the US. Both sources cite a lower number than what we found which suggests that this number may be inaccurate. It could differ because there are hospitals listed which have actually closed or not operational.

## Download Census zip code shapefile (10 pt) 

1. 
    a. The five file types are: xml (this stores metadata about the shapefile and information about variables), dbf (this contains attribute information in a table), prj (this contains projection and coordinate system information), shp (this is the main file that has the feature geometry), and shx(this is the index file of the feature geometry).
    b. The datasets have the following sizes: xml (16kb), dbf (6.4mb), prj (4kb), shp (837.5mb), shx (266kb)
2. 

```{python}
#Loading in data.
import geopandas as gpd 
import pandas as pd
filepath = "/Users/mithilaiyer/Documents/GitHub/psetdata/shp/gz_2010_us_860_00_500k.shp" 
pset4_geo = gpd.read_file(filepath)
pset4_geo['ZCTA5'] = pd.to_numeric(pset4_geo['ZCTA5'], errors='coerce')
#Restricted to Texas zipcodes
subset_geo = pset4_geo[(pset4_geo['ZCTA5'] >= 750) & (pset4_geo['ZCTA5'] <= 799)]

```

## Calculate zip code’s distance to the nearest hospital (20 pts) (*)

1. 
```{python}
#Calculate centroids
zips_all_centroids = pset4_geo.copy()
zips_all_centroids['centroid'] = zips_all_centroids.centroid
zips_all_centroids.set_geometry('centroid')

#Information on dimensions and columns
dimensions = zips_all_centroids.shape
print("Dimensions:", dimensions)
print(zips_all_centroids.info())
#The dataframe has 33,120 observations or unique zip codes. It has 7 columns (4 object, 1 integer, and 2 geometry). The centroid column is calculated from the geometry columm and is the mean of the points in the polygon. GeoID is the unique geographical identifier, ZCTAS and NAME describe the zip code, and LSAD is the legal statistical area definition. Finally, census area is the calculated area derived from the ungeneralized area.
```

2. 
```{python}
#Creating the Texas centroids GeoDataframe and sorting to check all the zip codes are in there 
zips_texas_centroids = zips_all_centroids[zips_all_centroids['ZCTA5'].str[:3].astype(int).between(750, 799)]
zips_texas_centroids = zips_texas_centroids.sort_values(by='ZCTA5', ascending=True)

#Creating the Texas + bordering states (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana) GeoDataframe and checking all codes are in there.

zips_texas_borderstates_centroids = zips_all_centroids[
    (
        zips_all_centroids['ZCTA5'].str[:3].astype(int).between(750, 799) |

zips_texas_borderstates_centroids = zips_texas_borderstates_centroids.sort_values(by='ZCTA5', ascending=True)

#There are 1935 unique zip codes in the Texas subset, and 4057 unique codes in the Texas and its bordering states subset.
